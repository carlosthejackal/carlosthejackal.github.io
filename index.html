<center><h2>DEALING WITH PREJUDICES PLACED ON YOU</h2></center>
<p><b>All of our advices are based on true experience and events to ensure accurate treatement given to our patients</p></b>
<p><h3>I have been dealing with prejudices for quite some time and I know how much it hurts getting a bad status for something you have not done.In fact my parents considered me a bad child.My mother and my sister thought I was a playboy and my dad thought I was a failure.This only grew worse when my sister's friends who were 18 years old associated me as a great pervert.The saddest thing here is that I was not what they thought I was,I always respected women and I have never played with someone's feelings,in fact it was a girl that broke my heart.Now I know that it hurts a lot and I even thought about commiting suicide.But I never killed myself,I continued helping people around me and I ignored my haters completely.I even decided to create this website to help people.The haters have no power,I continued living my life happily.If I had cared about what the haters said,I would not be here today.So my advice to you is that you should ignore those people and keep enjoying your life.YOU ARE NOT WHAT THEY TELL YOU.You are better than that.These people will only talk behind your back.They can't affect you in any way.Also remember that you are special and that you were brought down on this earth for a good purpose.So ignore these people and continue living because you are not what they call you,you are special.Just keep that in mind and continue living.Lift your right hand and place that on the left side of your chest,Do you hear that beating?It's your heart still beating till now.You were a given a reason to live this life and giving up so soon ain't of that reason I can ensure you that.Yes,I know it's hard for you to not care about their comments but whenever someone says something bad about you,think about something good about you.You were given this life to enjoy and to do stuff that you love.Ignore the haters and continue living</p></h3>

<h2 ALIGN='CENTER'>BULLYING</h2>
<p><b>Bullying is the use of superior strength or influence to indimate someone,typically to force them to do something or simply hurt them to prove of their superiority.Well a bully might seem like someone who has power and is superior but in other words,he is a coward and a loser.Bullies always look for people who are weaker than them to tease.Victims of bullying suffer long term mental health problems.It can even trigger suicide!!!So does bullying seem nice to you?The answer is of course NO!I have never been a victim of bullying,but I had already seen people being bullied.At first I was scared to act,but eventualy,I knew I had to be a hero.I started talking with these bullies,I told them to stop what they were doing,I went up to them even thought they were stronger in force.They even threatened to beat me but I never backed down.Eventually they stopped bullying the child.As you can see,it doesn't take much to stand up to a bully.You need to have the courage to stand upp to them!Don't be scared of them!Who knows?When you are standing up to a bully,you might have saved a life!When you stand up to a bully,you might make someone's LIFE better!Do you think about all of this?!Even if you are a victim of bullying,my best advice for you is to not fear the bully.If he gives you an order,TELL HIM NO!LISTEN TO ME!!YOU ARE STRONG HUMAN AND THIS BULLY IS WEAK!SO DON'T BE SCARED AND FIGHT BACK!When you are right,never fear anybody because when you are right,god is with you.So be fearless and stop bullying today.Make the world a better place</b></p>
