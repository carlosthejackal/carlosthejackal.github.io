<center><h2>DEALING WITH PREJUDICES PLACED ON YOU</h2></center>
<p><b>All of our advices are based on true experience and events to ensure accurate treatement given to our patients</p></b>
<p><h3>I have been dealing with prejudices for quite some time and I know how much it hurts getting a bad status for something you have not done.In fact my parents considered me a bad child.My mother and my sister thought I was a playboy and my dad thought I was a failure.This only grew worse when my sister's friends who were 18 years old associated me as a great pervert.The saddest thing here is that I was not what they thought I was,I always respected women and I have never played with someone's feelings,in fact it was a girl that broke my heart.Now I know that it hurts a lot and I even thought about commiting suicide.But I never killed myself,I continued helping people around me and I ignored my haters completely.I even decided to create this website to help people.The haters have no power,I continued living my life happily.If I had cared about what the haters said,I would not be here today.So my advice to you is that you should ignore those people and keep enjoying your life.YOU ARE NOT WHAT THEY TELL YOU.You are better than that.These people will only talk behind your back.They can't affect you in any way.Also remember that you are special and that you were brought down on this earth for a good purpose.So ignore these people and continue living because you are not what they call you,you are special.Just keep that in mind and continue living.Lift your right hand and place that on the left side of your chest,Do you hear that beating?It's your heart still beating till now.You were a given a reason to live this life and giving up so soon ain't of that reason I can ensure you that.Yes,I know it's hard for you to not care about their comments but whenever someone says something bad about you,think about something good about you.You were given this life to enjoy and to do stuff that you love.Ignore the haters and continue living</p></h3>

<h2 ALIGN='CENTER'>BULLYING</h2>
<p><b>Bullying is the use of superior strength or influence to indimate someone,typically to force them to do something or simply hurt them to prove of their superiority.Well a bully might seem like someone who has power and is superior but in other words,he is a coward and a loser.Bullies always look for people who are weaker than them to tease.Victims of bullying suffer long term mental health problems.It can even trigger suicide!!!So does bullying seem nice to you?The answer is of course NO!I have never been a victim of bullying,but I had already seen people being bullied.At first I was scared to act,but eventualy,I knew I had to be a hero.I started talking with these bullies,I told them to stop what they were doing,I went up to them even thought they were stronger.They even threatened to beat me but I never backed down.Eventually they stopped bullying the child.As you can see,it doesn't take much to stand up to a bully.You need to have the courage to stand up to them!Don't be scared of them!Who knows?When you are standing up to a bully,you might have saved a life!When you stand up to a bully,you might make someone's LIFE better!Do you think about all of this?!Even if you are a victim of bullying,my best advice for you is to not fear the bully.If he gives you an order,TELL HIM NO!LISTEN TO ME!!YOU ARE A STRONG HUMAN AND THIS BULLY IS WEAK!SO DON'T BE SCARED AND FIGHT BACK!When you are right,never fear anybody because when you are right,god is with you.So be fearless and stop bullying today.Make the world a better place</b></p>

<h2 ALIGN='CENTER'>Standing up for yourself</h2>
<p><b>I once heard a story about a girl.This girl was a victim of bulllying.At school,most of her classmates hated her(Around 3/4 of the class).These people were jealous of her and they bullied her every single day.The rest of the class saw what was happening but they didn't stand up for her.It was a very painful experience for this girl,just put yourself in her situation;You come to school everyday just to get mocked and disrespected in front of others and having ZERO friends to help you.This was the reality that this girl lived in and what a harsh reality it was.She suffered a great deppresion and she even cut her hand for that!!SHE WAS ALL ALONE!DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD CAN THAT BE?!!In spite of all of this,she picked herself up and stop doing harming herself by cutting her hand etc..She decided to stop caring about them and be happy.SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE WAS STRONG AND SHE WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY THESE HATERS.In the end,she succeeded.This is a true story and if you want to talk with the girl,please tell me about your difficulties in the form below and she will reply to your questions on this website itself.So as you can see,she passed in all of this and she could survive them.Today she is living happily even if all those kids are hating on her.SHE COULD DO IT.SHE COULD SURVIVE ALL OF THIS and so can you.You are strong and you can surely overcome all these difficulties.Just believe in yourself and live.</b></p>

<h1 ALIGN='CENTER'>Questions and Answers</h1>
<p><i>I'm feeling a bit depressed I just feel like crying and stuff can u give some advice please?</i></p>
<p>Yeah of course.The reason why you are feeling depressed is because of negative thoughts.When thinking about them,your mind will enter a state of depression.The best way to solve this situation is thinking positively.If you don't know what the negative thoughts are,take a piece of paper and write about your feelings and why you are sad.It shall help you find out which negative thoughts are affecting you.Then you need to stop thinking this way.Why?That's because they are affecting you and you are don't deserve this.You are someone special,you have lots of blessings around you.Think about it:You have proper food,you have a house to live under,you have proper education,you get clean water to drink.So many kids in the world want these commodities and yet you have them.That's not all,there is so much more about you.So many great things that you possess.You have to put that in your head.That's the first exercise:Think about how special you are,think about what I just told you,the number of things that you have that other kids desires.Think about all of this.Keep repeating them in your head.The second exercise that I'm gonna give you is to be grateful.Every night before going to sleep,take a piece of paper and write down all the blessings that you have.Write them down on a piece of paper and read them out.Read them for 2-3 times and then say:'Thank you for I have all these blessings"The reason I am telling you to do this is to make you realise about the number of positive things happening in your life.Just focus on those things and you shall be fine.Ignore the negative things,just think and focus on the positive things.I hope this was helpful and if you have any more questions,feel free to ask</p>
